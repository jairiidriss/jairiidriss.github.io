I am **Dr. Idriss JAIRI**, a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Artificial Intelligence at the [LIRMM (Montpellier Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics, and Microelectronics)](https://www.lirmm.fr/) in **Montpellier, France**.  
My research focuses on **deep learning for environmental and ecological intelligence**, particularly developing **multimodal AI systems** that integrate vision, audio, and sensor data to monitor and model complex natural phenomena such as **honeybee colony health**.  
Previously, I earned my **Ph.D. in Machine Learning** from the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/) ([CRIStAL Laboratory](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/)), where I designed **intelligent air quality indicators** and **explainable machine learning models** for environmental and health preservation.
